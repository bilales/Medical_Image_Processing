• Built a pipeline for 3D cardiac CT analysis, converting world-to-voxel coordinates for precise cropping.
• Developed advanced segmentation masks by applying complex boolean logic, including intensity thresholding, isolating the
largest connected component, and performing union/subtraction of key anatomical structures (atria, ventricles, aorta)
• Implemented Dice and Hausdorff validation metrics to quantitatively compare mask volumes and accuracy.
